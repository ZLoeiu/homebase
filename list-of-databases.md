# List of databases

This is a living document to survey basic information about specific Natural History databases. The purpose of this list is to act as reference for getting a superficial view of databases offering data.  

## Arctos

- Link: [Arctos](http://arctos.database.museum/home.cfm)
- About: This site, used by the UCB Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, houses data from dozens of universities and museums about mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, microorganism, and other types of specimens. 
- Type of data offered: Data is offered as specimen information (weight, size, sample types, etc) or as observation information (mostly hand-written or transcribed field notes)
- How to access data: Use the "search" function and its GUI to search by many different filters, including species name, locality (map capabilities too!), collector, etc.

## GBIF

- Link: [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)
- About: Aggregator site that unites many the dataset from over 40,000 other datasets. 
- Type of data offered: It appears as though every type of dataset is offered, but it is unclear how it is able to unite this data. 
- How to access data: In addition to being able to search by research type, for example [occurance](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search) or [species](https://www.gbif.org/developer/species). There is a [API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary) where you can be more specific.

## Google Earth Engine

- Link: [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)
- About: Earth Engine hosts satellite imagery and is a tool that allows for analysis of geospatial datasets, which are made available for global-scale data mining. Images of Earth may go back more than 40 years and are ingested on a daily basis. 
- Type of data offered: satellite imagery, geospatial
- How to access data: First, request access by [signing up](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/). Once accepted, browse the [data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/) and find a dataset that you're interested in! 

## Globi

- Link: [Globi](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/)
- About: Globi offers data about species interactions. Data is usually found in (organism) eats/is eaten by/interacts with/etc (another organism). With an experimental but exciting GUI, this database makes it relatively easy to find information about species interactions.
- Type of data offered: 2-point data: relationships between taxa, broadly.
- How to access data: Use the search engine on the landing page or the "Browse" feature, which is much more graphic.
