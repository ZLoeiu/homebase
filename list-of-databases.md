# List of databases

This is a living document to survey basic information about specific Natural History databases. The purpose of this list is to act as reference for getting a superficial view of databases offering data.  

## Arctos

- Link: [Arctos](http://arctos.database.museum/home.cfm)
- About: This site, used by the UCB Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, houses data from dozens of universities and museums about mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, microorganism, and other types of specimens. 
- Type of data offered: Data is offered as specimen information (weight, size, sample types, etc) or as observation information (mostly hand-written or transcribed field notes)
- How to access data: Use the "search" function and its GUI to search by many different filters, including species name, locality (map capabilities too!), collector, etc.

## GBIF

- Link: [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)
- About: Aggregator site that unites many the dataset from over 40,000 other datasets. 
- Type of data offered: It appears as though every type of dataset is offered, but it is unclear how it is able to unite this data. 
- How to access data: In addition to being able to search by research type, for example [occurance](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search) or [species](https://www.gbif.org/developer/species). There is a [API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary) where you can be more specific.

- Type of data offered: Data were converted into CSV text files and compressed into .zip files. VertNet generates a metadata** file that describes the contents contained within each zipped dataset. And finally, bundle up the metadata and the dataset and upload them to CyVerse.
- How to access data: All resources produced for and by VertNet are free and open to download. You can find them in the "Resources" >> "DATASETS, TOOLS & CODE" section.

## The Paleobiology Database

- Link: [The Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/)
- About: A public database of paleontological data that anyone can use, maintained by an international non-governmental group of paleontologists.
- Type of data offered: CSV, TSV, JSON, RIS
- How to access data: You can download by clicking "download data" on their home page. It allows you to download data of all types from the Paleobiology Database. Use the various fields and selectors to specify which information you are looking for, and the form will generate a URL that will retrieve that specific set of records using the data service API. You can also use one or more of the sections below to select a set of records and choose output options. If you close a section, you remove those parameters from the download URL until the section is opened again.

## Bird Sound Database

- Link: [Bird Sounds](https://www.xeno-canto.org/)
- About: Xeno-Canto is a website that shares bird sounds from around the world. It offers a collection of bird recording data which people/researchers/bird-lovers can access, use, and/or contribute to. 
- Type of data offered: This database offers the bird recordings of different birds in different parts of the world. The recordings also offer sonograms so that you can take a look at the graph presenting the distributing the sound-energy wavelengths. If you access "All Recordings", you are also supplied with the birds' scientific name, length, and type of call (aka a "call" or a "song"). There is also information on who recorded the sounds, where and when they recorded it, and various other remarks by the recorder. 
- How to access data: If you want to see/hear the bird recordings of birds in a specific region, you can drag a box around a the region on their map, and it'll help you locate the birds in those areas. You can also access all the recordings that they have by clicking on "Explore" -> "All Recordings". Clicking the play button on the avaliabe files will allow you to hear the bird sounds.
